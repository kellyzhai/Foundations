Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%)


Study the ROC Curve, decide threshold
Use 2 classifiers.

Random Forest
tune only: n_estimators: {4, 5, 10, 20, 50}

KNN Classfier
tune only: n_neighbors: {3, 5, 10, 20}

Which one performs better in the cross validation?

Cross-validation with 5-folds
