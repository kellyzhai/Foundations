Word Count Lab: Building a word count application

In this lab, we will write code that calculates the most common words in the Complete Works of William Shakespeare retrieved from Project Gutenberg. This could also be scaled to larger applications, such as finding the most common words in Wikipedia.

During this lab we will cover:

Part 1: Creating a base DataFrame and performing operations
Part 2: Counting with Spark SQL and DataFrames
Part 3: Finding unique words and a mean value
Part 4: Apply word count to a file
